Document Summarization using Transformers
Text summarization is one such typical research method that aids in handling massive 
amounts of data. Automatic summary is a well-known technique for distilling a document to 
its key points. It works by producing a condensed version of the text while maintaining 
important information. The two types of text summarization are extractive and abstractive. 
Extractive techniques of summarising reduce the workload of summary by selecting a 
selection of pertinentsentences from the original text. Although there are many different 
approaches, extractive approaches are particularly appealing to academics with an interest in 
Natural Language Processing (NLP). The implications of phrases are determined using 
linguistic and statistical traits.
Large text summaries continue to be a challenge for natural language processing. Large 
papers are summarised via summarization. Text summarising is the technique of using 
software to condense a text document into a brief summary that highlights the key ideas from 
the original text..Based on the type of input, text summarizers can be categorised: Small input 
in a single document's textual environment. Multiple documents with potentially lengthy 
input. According to the goal, summarizer may be categorised as generic, meaning that the 
model treats the input objectively and without prejudice. domain-specific, where the model 
makes advantage of domain data to create a more precise summary based on verified 
knowledge. Query-based, with the summary only including known responses to queries about 
the input text that are asked in natural language. According to output type, summarizer may 
be divided into: extractive, where key phrases are picked out of the source material to provide 
a summary. abstract, where the model creates its own words and sentences to provide a more 
well-rounded summary, similar to what a person would provide. In general, abstract 
summarization is a more difficult work than extractive techniques.
